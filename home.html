        <p class="text">During my time at Indiana University so far, I have discovered what I have a passion for software engineering. That has then led me to acquire skills in:
        <p class="bullet_point">• Languages: Python, Racket, Java, C/C++</p>
        <p class="bullet_point">• Platforms: UNIX, Microsoft Windows</p>
        <p class="bullet_point">• Databases: SQL, NoSQL</p>
        <p class="bullet_point">• Web Development: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MERN</p>
        <p class="bullet_point">• Miscellaneous: Data Structures, Adobe XD, Git, Excel</p>
        <p class="text">Outside of my classroom education, I have taken up leadership as the President of the National Society of Black Engineers at Indiana University. As the President of the organization, it is important for me to support every member to achieve our goals, both as a group and individually. Additionally, seeking to collaborate with students, faculty, and staff to create an even better community. Not only with those within NSBE, but with Indiana University as a whole and our neighbors locally and afar.

        For my job as a licensed life insurance producer, it is my responsibility to help provide life insurance to those who want it. Even though it is not directly related to engineering, it has improved my ability to communicate with others. Mainly because I have to collaborate and communicate with the client to make sure that they get the best insurance based on their situation.</p>
