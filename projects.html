        <h2 class="project_title">Portfolio Website</h2>
        <h6 class="project_date">February 2021</h6>
        <p class="text">Using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, I made a portfolio about myself. It includes an “about me” section, a section that highlights my projects, and a resume page that includes a downloadable resume. Also, there is a footer section on each page that includes a link to my LinkedIn and my email address. To create the portfolio, I used various formatting techniques to get my information across. One of those ways included the skeleton formatting for HTML. This formatting helped me put in place the title, contents, and footer of each page. Combined with CSS and JavaScript, it has helped me understand the basics of website development and the frontend side of it. </p>

        <h2 class="project_title">Biography website of Adele Goldberg</h2>
        <h6 class="project_date">March 2021</h6>
        <p class="text">I used HTML/CSS to create the biography website of Adele Goldberg. To do this project, however, I had to work with a team. The team had three separate groups. One to gather information on Adele Goldberg, another to design the website, and one person to create the website using HTML/CSS. My role in the process was to create the website using HTML/CSS. This project has taught me how to work in a team setting with website development. The result of my team's information and design has taught me how to communicate with my team, as well as problem-solve to reach our goal.</p>

        <h2 class="project_title">MERN application </h2>
        <h6 class="project_date">June 2021 - July 2021</h6>
        <p class="text">Using the MERN stack, I made a simple website application to make a post. Creating this website gave me a basic understanding about stacks and backend development using Java. </p>

        <h2 class="project_title">Website for the nonprofit organization “My Chosen People” </h2>
        <h6 class="project_date">October 2021 - March 2022</h6>
        <p class="text">I led a group of students from my school to create the website for the nonprofit organization My Chosen People. During the website development process, we used a combination of methods to reach our final goal. Including Adobe XD to design the website, GitHub to share our code and host the website, and HTML/CSS and JavaScript to make the website. To help reach our goals, we held periodic meetings to help teach the methods we used in the website development process. Over time, we’ll continue to update the website with information as they give us it.</p>

        <h2 class="project_title">Stocks Predictor</h2>
        <h6 class="project_date">February 2021 - Current</h6>
        <p class="text">While working on a team, my partner and I goal is to create an algorithm that can predict stocks. To first do this project, we used Python to unpack and clean stock datasets from Kaggle. Those datasets included the past trends of the stocks. Based on analyzing that data, we then are creating an algorithm to predict the stocks. This project is ongoing, though as we go along, I’ll share the results of the project.</p>
